# Frontend Mentor - Age calculator app solution

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I used this project to familiarize myself more with React. In the process, I learned to: use vite to initialize a React project, React components - subcomponents to build out my UI, conditional jsx for responsive UI, React use-state for persistant component data, and react-spring for animations. I also used this project to build out my UI with mobile first in mind, contrare to my usual approach.
